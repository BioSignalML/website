# Software Packages

A number of software libraries, applications, and utilities have been created for BioSignalML, including:

## Libraries

[libbiosignalml](https://github.com/BioSignalML/libbiosignalml)
: A C++ library for working with BioSignalML metadata and HDF5.

[biosignalml-python](https://github.com/BioSignalML/biosignalml-python)
: A Python package which provides an interface to a BioSignalML repository and several different biosignal formats, including EDF+, WFDB and HDF5.

## Applications

[biosignalml-server](https://github.com/BioSignalML/biosignalml-server)
: A Python based web repository for BioSignalML recordings, providing both SPARQL query services and a web-socket based streaming interface. 

[biosignal-browser](https://github.com/BioSignalML/biosignalml-browser)
: A Python Qt based interface to a repository, allowing signals to be queried, viewed, and annotated.

**OpenCOR plugin**
: An interface for [OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/) allowing BioSignalML recordings to be used in simulations.

## Utilities

**biosignalml-utilities**
: Including BioSignalML from PDF recordings made by portable ECG devices.

**biosignalml-streams**
: Utilities to stream BioSignalML between repositories and telemetry systems.
